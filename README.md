# Lab_Regular_Expressions

These are three straightforward exercises on the subject of RegEx that we did in school. The solutions can be found in the folders (Ex1, Ex2 and Ex3). The "Lab_Regular_Expressions" folder contains nothing. I used it to construct the other solutions in one place rather than three separate files.
